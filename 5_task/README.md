# SPEEDGAME APP

## HELSINKI BUSINESS COLLEGE

An advancement based on idea developed by my Teacher **Tennosar Margit** in the classroom.

This game tends to test your speed as the fastest finger. You click on the circle in turns as highlighted, if clicked on a wrong circle then it's GAME OVER and your score is displayed on the screen.

Created using *Reactjs*

**NB:** Still an on-going project.
